## Configuration

The logging handler for your application is registered in the `app/start/global.php` [start file](/docs/lifecycle#start-files). By default, the logger is configured to use a single log file; however, you may customize this behavior as needed. Since Laravel uses the popular [Monolog](https://github.com/Seldaek/monolog) logging library, you can take advantage of the variety of handlers that Monolog offers.

For example, if you wish to use daily log files instead of a single, large file, you can make the following change to your start file:

	$logFile = 'laravel.log';

	Log::useDailyFiles(storage_path().'/logs/'.$logFile);

### Error Detail

By default, error detail is enabled for your application. This means that when an error occurs you will be shown an error page with a detailed stack trace and error message. You may turn off error details by setting the `debug` option in your `app/config/app.php` file to `false`.

> **Note:** It is strongly recommended that you turn off error detail in a production environment.

## Handling Errors

By default, the `app/start/global.php` file contains an error handler for all exceptions:

	App::error(function(Exception $exception)
	{
		Log::error($exception);
	});

This is the most basic error handler. However, you may specify more handlers if needed. Handlers are called based on the type-hint of the Exception they handle. For example, you may create a handler that only handles `RuntimeException` instances:

	App::error(function(RuntimeException $exception)
	{
		// Handle the exception...
	});

If an exception handler returns a response, that response will be sent to the browser and no other error handlers will be called:

	App::error(function(InvalidUserException $exception)
	{
		Log::error($exception);

		return 'Sorry! Something is wrong with this account!';
	});

To listen for PHP fatal errors, you may use the `App::fatal` method:

	App::fatal(function($exception)
	{
		//
	});

If you have several exception handlers, they should be defined from most generic to most specific. So, for example, a handler that handles all exceptions of type `Exception` should be defined before a custom exception type such as `Illuminate\Encryption\DecryptException`.

### Where To Place Error Handlers

There is no default "home" for error handler registrations. Laravel offers you freedom in this area. One option is to define the handlers in your `start/global.php` file. In general, this is a convenient location to place any "bootstrapping" code. If that file is getting crowded, you could create an `app/errors.php` file, and `require` that file from your `start/global.php` script. A third option is to create a [service provider](/docs/ioc#service-providers) that registers the handlers. Again, there is no single "correct" answer. Choose a location that you are comfortable with.

## HTTP Exceptions

Some exceptions describe HTTP error codes from the server. For example, this may be a "page not found" error (404), an "unauthorized error" (401) or even a developer generated 500 error. In order to return such a response, use the following:

	App::abort(404);

Optionally, you may provide a response:

	App::abort(403, 'Unauthorized action.');

This method may be used at any time during the request's lifecycle.

## Handling 404 Errors

You may register an error handler that handles all "404 Not Found" errors in your application, allowing you to easily return custom 404 error pages:

	App::missing(function($exception)
	{
		return Response::view('errors.missing', array(), 404);
	});

## Logging

The Laravel logging facilities provide a simple layer on top of the powerful [Monolog](http://github.com/seldaek/monolog) library. By default, Laravel is configured to create a single log file for your application, and this file is stored in `app/storage/logs/laravel.log`. You may write information to the log like so:

	Log::info('This is some useful information.');

	Log::warning('Something could be going wrong.');

	Log::error('Something is really going wrong.');

The logger provides the seven logging levels defined in [RFC 5424](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424): **debug**, **info**, **notice**, **warning**, **error**, **critical**, and **alert**.

An array of contextual data may also be passed to the log methods:

	Log::info('Log message', array('context' => 'Other helpful information'));

Monolog has a variety of additional handlers you may use for logging. If needed, you may access the underlying Monolog instance being used by Laravel:

	$monolog = Log::getMonolog();

You may also register an event to catch all messages passed to the log:

#### Registering A Log Listener

	Log::listen(function($level, $message, $context)
	{
		//
	});
